            <h1>ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Samuel Amartey Armah, and I am a results-driven professional with over three years of experience in customer service. 
                During my time at Multichoice Ghana and Milvik Ghana Limited, I had the opportunity to interact with diverse clients, 
                supporting them through phone, email, and live chat. These experiences strengthened my communication, problem-solving, 
                and interpersonal skills, while also teaching me the importance of patience, empathy, and consistency in building strong 
                customer relationships. <br><br>Beyond customer service, I have developed a keen interest in data analytics and data engineering, 
                recognizing the growing importance of data in shaping business decisions. Over the past months, I have invested in building my 
                technical expertise through courses in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel, while also exploring cloud technologies such as AWS. 
                These skills have enabled me to work on projects that involve data cleaning, visualization, and building ETL pipelines, sharpening my 
                ability to analyze data and derive actionable insights. <br><br>I am currently enrolled in a training program at Blossom Academy, where I am 
                further enhancing my data analytics and engineering skills. This program has not only broadened my technical knowledge but also 
                strengthened my ability to work with real-world datasets, design scalable solutions, and present insights effectively to stakeholders. 
                My learning journey has been both challenging and rewarding, fueling my passion for continuous growth and innovation in the data space. 
                Looking ahead, my career goal is to become a well-rounded data engineering professional who can bridge the gap between people and data.
